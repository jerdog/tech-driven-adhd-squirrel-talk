Jeremy is a Developer Relations and Community professional, formerly the Director of DevRel & Community at CircleCI, and previously at Solace, Auth0, and XDA. With almost 30 years in Tech, covering just about every functional area including Support, SysAdmin, Application Developer, Program Manager, and Business Analyst, Jeremy is active in the DevRel and DevOps communities, and is a co-creator of DevOpsPartyGames.com. A lover of all things coffee, community, open source, and tech, he’s a husband and father, and is also house-broken, and (generally) plays well with others.

#### Abstract

Come along on this ADHD-fueled journey as Jeremy tells _some_ of his journey in tech, all while trying to stay on topic. He’ll dive into some of his early days “hunting squirrels” while also keeping the local librarians employed. He’ll also touch on his experiences through the early days of the internet (not ARPANET, but the “world wide web”) and how he learned to “cope” with this thing called ADHD, without _really_ coping with it, until he had to. You’ll hopefully laugh, probably cry, and that will just be from having to listen to him try to stay on topic, while also hopefully gaining a better feeling of how it’s ok to ask for help, and to also occasionally experiment with new ideas and being open about your journey through life.

_Note to conference organizers: This session really is more about sharing my journey through tech and mental health, and hopefully it will resonate with some people and encourage others to do the same. It is not a traditional technical talk, and fits more in a keynote or life skills or community category._
