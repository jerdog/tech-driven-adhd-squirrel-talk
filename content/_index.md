### Confessions of an ADHD-fueled technologi‚Ä¶. üêøÔ∏è!

How many of you are introverts? How many wish you could just tell people to go away, and leave you alone, and let you just do your own thing? 

How do you do it? Because that‚Äôs not me. Like, at all. Not even in the slightest. I mean, sure there are moments, but those are when I dropping the squirrels off at the pool! Otherwise,

I think Dani Donovan accurately represented what you all are about to experience. I‚Äôm gonna bounce around here with different stories and hopefully arrive at a point, but this is an ADHD talk, so what did you expect?

Covid sucked. In so many ways, but that first year, geez did it suck: being stuck at home, couldn‚Äôt really go anywhere, and if you did, you were supposed to keep 6 feet between you and the next human at all times. The only real contact was with people you requested to come to your home to drop food off, until the apps created that ‚Äúno contact mode‚Äù,

which meant you didn‚Äôt have to deal with that awkward moment of receiving your groceries from someone you didn‚Äôt know. I know, I‚Äôm probably describing an introvert‚Äôs heaven. But that was _so_ not me.

I have been in Developer Relations in some way for the last 15 years, and really I‚Äôve just been doing it for probably my entire almost 30 years in tech, often without even knowing it. Let‚Äôs begin at the beginning, because the organizers told me I could talk as long as I wanted.

I am a child of the mid-70s. That means, I grew up knowing about (and using) all of these things. It just seemed that for me, and many of my generation, that we took to technology so easily.

There wasn‚Äôt a lot I could focus on, but reading - man that was something I could do for hours, and days, on end. I read everything I could get my hands on. In 1984 Pizza Hut started this summer reading campaign called BOOK IT where you would read X number of books and then get a free personal pan pizza. I ate so much pizza that year, and many summers after. I‚Äôm not saying that Pizza Hut ignited my desire to read, but I‚Äôm not _not_ saying it either.

Some of my earliest memories was going to the library to check out books. In a laundry basket. Every two weeks. Full. I have yet to this day seen so many librarians get so happy at the same time, much less fight over who got to check us out.

I hooked and messed around with them as often as I could, wherever I could. In the early 1980s my uncle worked for a company that provided IT services to the US Government in the early 80s, and let me mess around and borrow these just about as often as I wanted:

When I was about 8 I was privileged to get a computer from that same uncle, that had previously been thrown out by the Government, because each year they had to replace things or else they wouldn‚Äôt get the budget renewed.

So, since he worked for a government IT contractor, he just started stockpiling these ‚Äúold‚Äù, thrown out machines, and gave me one like this around 1984 or so. It weighed 32lb, so that Compaq Portable Plus truly was portable.

That love for computers, and trying everything I would read, led me to start typing things in without really reading the rest of the book. I would just type odd commands in that I found in the book _just_to see what was going to happen. Anyone know what this is gonna do?

It‚Äôs gonna make you have to say, ‚ÄúSo, mom and dad. The computer isn‚Äôt working right now, but don‚Äôt worry. I know why. I‚Äôll just be downstairs for the next few hours putting some files back on the computer.‚Äù But who I was I kidding? It took over a day, because everything was on 5.25‚Äù disks, installing DOS 3 back onto an 20MB MFM RLL drive. But, I sure as hell didn‚Äôt do that again.

Prior to the summer of 1984, I had been going to a private school, but in 4th grade my parents took me and my sister (2 years younger than me) out and started homeschooling us. The stated reason at the time was that they felt it was their responsibility as parents to teach us - it was a religious-based decision.

Later in life when I was in my late 20s, I would come to find out that the contributing factor to them beginning to explore options was because I was struggling to focus, a bit hyper, trouble making friends, and getting picked on due to all of those. Because of my ADHD.

There was this one story that I kept repeating later in life that stood out as an early memory, which was one of the last ones at that school. And no, it‚Äôs not the story of my first kiss in 3rd grade with Heather at the high school basketball game (this private school was K-12), and then immediately afterwards her getting her head stuck in the bars overlooking the court. Those two facts have _nothing_ to do with each other.

No, it‚Äôs the story of the first half of my 3rd grade year when we would play kickball at recess, and me and these 5 other guys were always a team. And we would always win, even beating teams of older elementary kids. Every recess.

And then after Winter break, suddenly I was told I wasn‚Äôt on their team, had never been on their team, and why would they have me, a kid with glasses, on their kickball team? I was devastated. And this repeated itself for weeks, until I finally stopped asking. And found something else to play.

I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with ADHD then, because this was the early 80s, and my parents firmly believed that ADHD wasn‚Äôt real, and was just an excuse for parents not to spend time with their kids and to shut them up so they could go work two jobs in order to afford a living.

So I started homeschooling. Which dovetailed nicely with my obsession with tech and computers and reading and I excelled in that structure. Because of my ADHD.

Ok, back to Covid. After over a year in lockdowns, a few of my buddies and I decided we needed to get away and were going to drive to Colorado and camp for 3 nights or so in early April.

Oh. So before that though, my mental state had been getting progressively worse - I know, some of you have only known me for the last year or so. You‚Äôre getting a completely different side of me _after_ medication. There are some of you _blessed_ to have known the pre-medicated Jeremy.

During that first year of Covid lockdowns, many people I know, oddly a lot of them _in_ DevRel, found out and started posting that they had gotten diagnosed with ADHD and were in therapy, and I was so excited and happy for them that they had found that! I also said to myself, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really odd that I‚Äôm not like them, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

So where were we? Oh yeah - my worsening mental state. I had begun noticing that I was more irritable with my family (well they informed me I was), I was losing my trains of thought, finding it really hard to focus, and even _not_ being able to find the words to say something even though it was _right there on the tip of my tongue_.

Finally, I got concerned, and went to my doctor in May of 2021. I told her what I was experiencing, and she of course mentioned it could be any number of things, but they would do some blood tests and then go from there. I heard back from the doctor later that day as I was finalizing my camping trip to Colorado. The nurse gave me these results:

and then told me I had iron-deficiency anemia, to get on high doses of Iron, and they needed me to come in for some more tests the next week before they identified next steps. I said, ‚ÄúOk. Well I‚Äôm leaving for a camping trip in the mountains of Colorado, and will be gone. Can we wait a week?‚Äù And her response, almost verbatim, was, ‚ÄúYou should not go to Colorado. You will end up in the hospital.‚Äù
