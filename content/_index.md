### Confessions of an ADHD-fueled technologi‚Ä¶. üêøÔ∏è!

How many of you are introverts? How many wish you could just tell people to go away, and leave you alone, and let you just do your own thing? 

How do you do it? Because that‚Äôs not me. Like, at all. Not even in the slightest. I mean, sure there are moments, but those are when I dropping the squirrels off at the pool! Otherwise,

Covid sucked. In so many ways, but that first year, geez did it suck: being stuck at home, couldn‚Äôt really go anywhere, and if you did, you were supposed to keep 6 feet between you and the next human at all times. The only real contact was with people you requested to come to your home to drop food off, until the apps created that ‚Äúno contact mode‚Äù,

I have been in Developer Relations in some way for the last 15 years, and really I‚Äôve just been doing it for probably my entire almost 30 years in tech, often without even knowing it. Let‚Äôs begin at the beginning, because the organizers told me I could talk as long as I wanted.

I am a child of the mid-70s. That means, I grew up knowing about (and using) all of these things. It just seemed that for me, and many of my generation, that we took to technology so easily.

There wasn‚Äôt a lot I could focus on, but reading - man that was something I could do for hours, and days, on end. I read everything I could get my hands on. In 1984 Pizza Hut started this summer reading campaign called BOOK IT where you would read X number of books and then get a free personal pan pizza. I ate so much pizza that year, and many summers after. I‚Äôm not saying that Pizza Hut ignited my desire to read, but I‚Äôm not _not_ saying it either.

Some of my earliest memories was going to the library to check out books. In a laundry basket. Every two weeks. Full. I have yet to this day seen so many librarians get so happy at the same time, much less fight over who got to check us out.

So, since he worked for a government IT contractor, he just started stockpiling these ‚Äúold‚Äù, thrown out machines, and gave me one like this around 1984 or so. It weighed 32lb, so that Compaq Portable Plus truly was portable.

That love for computers, and trying everything I would read, led me to start typing things in without really reading the rest of the book. I would just type odd commands in that I found in the book _just_to see what was going to happen. Anyone know what this is gonna do?

It‚Äôs gonna make you have to say, ‚ÄúSo, mom and dad. The computer isn‚Äôt working right now, but don‚Äôt worry. I know why. I‚Äôll just be downstairs for the next few hours putting some files back on the computer.‚Äù But who I was I kidding? It took over a day, because everything was on 5.25‚Äù disks, installing DOS 3 back onto an 20MB MFM RLL drive. But, I sure as hell didn‚Äôt do that again.

Prior to the summer of 1984, I had been going to a private school, but in 4th grade my parents took me and my sister (2 years younger than me) out and started homeschooling us. The stated reason at the time was that they felt it was their responsibility as parents to teach us - it was a religious-based decision.

Later in life when I was in my late 20s, I would come to find out that the contributing factor to them beginning to explore options was because I was struggling to focus, a bit hyper, trouble making friends, and getting picked on due to all of those. Because of my ADHD.

There was this one story that I kept repeating later in life that stood out as an early memory, which was one of the last ones at that school. And no, it‚Äôs not the story of my first kiss in 3rd grade with Heather at the high school basketball game (this private school was K-12), and then immediately afterwards her getting her head stuck in the bars overlooking the court. Those two facts have _nothing_ to do with each other.

No, it‚Äôs the story of the first half of my 3rd grade year when we would play kickball at recess, and me and these 5 other guys were always a team. And we would always win, even beating teams of older elementary kids. Every recess. 
{{% /note %}}

{{% note %}}
And then after Winter break, suddenly I was told I wasn‚Äôt on their team, had never been on their team, and why would they have me, a kid with glasses, on their kickball team? I was devastated. And this repeated itself for weeks, until I finally stopped asking. And found something else to play.

I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with ADHD then, because this was the early 80s, and my parents firmly believed that ADHD wasn‚Äôt real, and was just an excuse for parents not to spend time with their kids and to shut them up so they could go work two jobs in order to afford a living.

So I started homeschooling. Which dovetailed nicely with my obsession with tech and computers and reading and I excelled in that structure. Because of my ADHD.

During that first year of Covid lockdowns, many people I know, oddly a lot of them _in_ DevRel, found out and started posting that they had gotten diagnosed with ADHD and were in therapy, and I was so excited and happy for them that they had found that!

So where were we? Oh yeah - my worsening mental state. I had begun noticing that I was more irritable with my family (well they informed me I was), I was losing my trains of thought, finding it really hard to focus, and even _not_ being able to find the words to say something even though it was _right there on the tip of my tongue_.

Finally, I got concerned, and went to my doctor in May of 2021. I told her what I was experiencing, and she of course mentioned it could be any number of things, but they would do some blood tests and then go from there. I heard back from the doctor later that day as I was finalizing my camping trip to Colorado. The nurse gave me these results, and then told me I had iron-deficiency anemia, to get on high doses of Iron, and they needed me to come in for some more tests the next week before they identified next steps.

I said, ‚ÄúOk. Good to know. So I‚Äôm leaving for a camping trip in the mountains of Colorado, and will be gone. Can we wait a week?‚Äù And her response, almost verbatim, was, ‚ÄúYou should not go to Colorado. You will end up in the hospital.‚Äù

Now let me tell you about me and mountains. They are my happy place. I grew up in the flatlands (Kansas), and my only experience with ‚Äúmountains‚Äù was the Appalachians and the Great Smoky Mountains in the East. I never saw real mountains in person, and really never traveled further west than Sydney, NE, until 1998 when I traveled with some friends to a college conference in Denver, Colorado.

{{% note %}}
I was in complete, and total awe. I was hooked. Over the last 25 years I‚Äôve traveled West more than East, and seen more mountains than I had previously thought possible, hiked quite a few, and even had the privilege of hiking the highest mountain in the American Rockies, Mount Elbert, outside Leadville, Colorado with my wife.

I‚Äôve probably taken more pictures of mountains than people in the last 10 to 15 years, or at least my pictures have a lot more mountains in them than not. I even got emotional in October 2021 when I flew over mountains, and could see them from the plane, for the first time since February 2020.

So back to the call with the nurse:

{{% note %}}
I was in shock. I had been planning this mountain camping trip with my buddies for months, and was literally leaving in a few days. After just over a year of dealing with isolation, my mental challenges, and all the things, a trip to the mountains was exactly what I needed. And I was getting denied that. After getting off the phone, I sat dumbfounded for a few moments, and then I cried. Not like a few tears - it was a heaving, draining cry. I was devastated.

Luckily, my friends were understanding, and suggested we go to the Ozarks in northwest Arkansas instead, and still make the most of it. I was thankful for that, and it definitely helped, but it wasn‚Äôt the same. I mean, come on. Who wants this‚Ä¶.

I had blood drawn multiple times, was poked, prodded, got an endoscopy AND a colonoscopy at the same time (because I‚Äôm a ROCK STAR - you get the ‚Äúgeologist‚Äù joke now?), and all sorts of other tests to figure out what was wrong because there had to be a bleed somewhere to explain those test results. But there wasn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt have _any_ of the symptoms that normally came from severe iron-deficiency anemia. So the only thing was to continue consuming vast quantities of iron supplements and wait for the results to go up, and also to wait to get into the neuropsychologist.

That of course wasn‚Äôt a surprise, because to my parents, ADHD was a myth and just an attempt by ‚Äúbig-pharma‚Äù to make lots of money and get people addicted (this same excuse and faulty reasoning would surface _many_ times from them whenever their Facebook doctor/nurse/‚Äúscientist‚Äù/etc. had something to sell, or a global pandemic was on the loose, etc.).

But also, I was homeschooled and so for someone with ADHD, short classes, no homework, context switching, and time to either go outside or later get a job was a dream. The accommodations were baked in! Even my first few jobs were perfect for my neurodiverse brain.

For example, i remember fondly working at a bakery where I got to chat with a lot of senior citizens (the bakery was in an older, wealthy neighborhood) who were just thrilled to have someone express interest in the stories from back in the day. I loved hearing tales of the wagons going west, hot gossip from the neighborhood a which included things like how it was rumored the Donner party ate just a little too much for their own good.

### How ADHD had been helpful

<p class="fragment" style="font-size: .75em;">1. Relate technical concepts to different groups of people</p>
<p class="fragment" style="font-size: .75em;">2. Get a grasp of the latest and greatest technologies and concepts</p>
<p class="fragment" style="font-size: .75em;">3. Step into the inherent ‚Äúcontext-switching‚Äù that tech, and DevRel requires</p>

I began to realize for myself and my technology journey, how my ADHD had been extremely helpful:

1. Relate technical concepts to different groups of people
2. Get a grasp of the latest and greatest technologies and concepts
3. Step into the inherent ‚Äúcontext-switching‚Äù that tech, and DevRel requires
{{% /note %}}

{{% note %}}
But that wasn‚Äôt enough. As I adjusted to the medication, and doing work and life and such, I kinda had to start all over with understanding how I functioned. I found myself being able to shift easily between different tasks as needed (which I always could - probably too easily), and then REMEMBERING to come back to the previous task (a NEW thing for me). However this also heightened my propensity to overwork and not take the breaks necessary.

I also started going to therapy, which was an important thing for me to start to process and understand how my way of thinking and working (and also how my lack of thinking, working, and coping since 2020) was affecting me and those around me and my relationships with my family, my wife and kids. And to also understand deep down how that experience of being excluded in kickball, and then ripped away from what I knew without any explanation, had shaped me. And how I approached many different situations and communities and relationships with this thought

Therapy has been a really good resource for me, helping me dig into all of this and identify ways that work for me to get things done and interact and communicate better with those around me. My therapist also introduced me into the idea of practicing mindfulness. Here‚Äôs the description from the Mayo Clinic:

> Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.

-The Mayo Clinic

Spending too much time planning, problem-solving, daydreaming, or thinking negative or random thoughts can be draining. It can also make you more likely to experience stress, anxiety and symptoms of depression. Practicing mindfulness exercises can help you direct your attention away from this kind of thinking and engage with the world around you.

It helped identify one of the biggest triggers for me around my ADHD, and maybe this is for you as well. Whenever I would start to feel anxious, or out of control with what was going on around me, or overwhelmed with tasks, etc. I would start to feel a bit off in my body. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but just a feeling of ‚Äúugh‚Äù and my heart rate kind of spiking, etc.

He helped me to start to recognize when that happened and to identify what I was feeling, what was going on around me, etc. and then to turn that into taking a few moments to breathe. Write down what I was doing, or needed to be done. Go walk around. Get a glass of water. Anything to break up that spiraling moment, and then move forward.

I also asked a few weeks ago for people to share their own experiences and tips and resources on their ADHD journey. Interestingly enough, most of them were diagnosed later in life. Here is what they shared:

Floor brings up that adult-diagnosed ADHD means you have coping mechanisms... build on them. For her she uses lists, and knitting. There's something about doing something with your hands.

Hannele ("Honnelay") had some more with embracing temporary habits, don't stress on streaks. Stick with what you're doing while it works, and don't try to force it. Also mentioned using lists, and even prep for the next day, but it's OK to not do everything.

Cass uses a planner and decorates it so that it truly is hers and her personality, and brings in ownership - and makes it fun. And then she blocks out time to focus, and makes sure to focus on what's on her to-do list.

My good friend Halcyon uses lists to break through the paralysis of figuring out what to do and avoiding procrastination, and removes distractions from around him which he knows will get in the way of being productive (which explains why he seems to disappear when I'm around....)
