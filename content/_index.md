### Confessions of an ADHD-fueled technologi…. 🐿️!

{{% note %}}
How many of you are introverts? How many wish you could just tell people to go away, and leave you alone, and let you just do your own thing? 

How do you do it? Because that’s not me. Like, at all. Not even in the slightest. I mean, sure there are moments, but those are when I dropping the squirrels off at the pool! Otherwise,

Covid sucked. In so many ways, but that first year, geez did it suck: being stuck at home, couldn’t really go anywhere, and if you did, you were supposed to keep 6 feet between you and the next human at all times.

The only real contact was with people you requested to come to your home to drop food off, until the apps created that “no contact mode”, which meant you didn’t have to deal with that awkward moment of receiving your groceries from someone you didn’t know. I know, I’m probably describing an introvert’s heaven. But that was _so_ not me. I thrive when I'm around people. Let me tell you a bit about me.

I am a child of the mid-70s. That means, I grew up knowing about (and using) all of these things. It just seemed that for me, and many of my generation, that we took to technology so easily.

There wasn’t a lot I could focus on, but reading - man that was something I could do for hours, and days, on end. I read everything I could get my hands on.

In 1984 Pizza Hut started this summer reading campaign called BOOK IT where you would read a certain number of books and then get a free personal pan pizza. I ate so much pizza that year, and many summers after. I’m not saying that Pizza Hut ignited my desire to read, but I’m not _not_ saying it either.

Riveting stuff, amirite?
I was hooked and messed around with them as often as I could, wherever I could. In the early 1980s my uncle worked for a company that provided IT services to the US Government in the early 80s, and let me mess around and borrow these just about as often as I wanted.

It’s gonna make you have to say, “So, mom and dad. The computer isn’t working right now, but don’t worry. I know why. I’ll just be downstairs for the next few hours putting some files back on the computer.” But who I was I kidding? It took over a day, because everything was on 5.25” disks, installing DOS 3 back onto an 20MB MFM RLL drive. But, I sure as hell didn’t do that again. Until Slackware Linux and the great `rm -rf` command.

Prior to the summer of 1984, I had been going to a private school, but in 4th grade my parents took me and my sister (2 years younger than me) out and started homeschooling us. The stated reason at the time was that they felt it was their responsibility as parents to teach us - it was a religious-based decision.

Later in life when I was in my late 20s, I would come to find out that the contributing factor to them beginning to explore options was because I was struggling to focus, a bit hyper, trouble making friends, and getting picked on due to all of those. Those were all symptoms.

There was this one story that I kept repeating later in life that stood out as an early memory, which was one of the last ones at that school. And no, it’s not the story of my first kiss in 3rd grade with Heather at the high school basketball game (this private school was K-12), and then immediately afterwards her getting her head stuck in the bars overlooking the court. Those two facts have _nothing_ to do with each other.

And then after Winter break, suddenly I was told I wasn’t on their team, had never been on their team, and why would they have me, a kid with glasses, on their kickball team? I was devastated. And this repeated itself for weeks, until I finally stopped asking. And found something else to play. How many of you ever tried playing tetherball by yourself?

I wasn’t diagnosed with ADHD then, because this was the early 80s, and my parents firmly believed that ADHD wasn’t real, and was just an excuse for parents not to spend time with their kids and to shut them up so they could go work two jobs in order to afford a living.

The nurse gave me these results, and then told me I had iron-deficiency anemia, to get on high doses of Iron, and come in for some more tests in a few days to then identify next steps. Now, again, I'm not a doctor, but I do know _now_ that these results were not good. Like at all. Red blood cells carry hemoglobin which carries oxygen in the blood, and dictate how much oxygen your body tissue gets. WBC help your immune system fight infection. All of which are only slightly important during a certain pandemic.

Now let me tell you about me and mountains. They are my happy place. I grew up in the flatlands (Kansas), and my only experience with “mountains” was the Appalachians and the Great Smoky Mountains in the East. I never saw real mountains in person, and really never traveled further west than Sydney, NE, until 1998 when I traveled with some friends to a college conference in Denver, Colorado.

I was in shock. I had been planning this mountain camping trip with my buddies for months, and was literally leaving in a few days. After just over a year of dealing with isolation, my mental challenges, and all the things, a trip to the mountains was exactly what I needed. And I was getting denied that. After getting off the phone, I sat dumbfounded for a few moments, and then I cried. Not like a few tears - it was a heaving, draining cry. I was devastated.

I had blood drawn multiple times, was poked, prodded, got an endoscopy AND a colonoscopy at the same time (because I’m a ROCK STAR - you get the “geologist” joke now?), and all sorts of other tests to figure out what was wrong because there had to be a bleed somewhere to explain those test results.

### ADHD
>a mental condition, beginning in childhood and often persisting into later life, that is characterized by persistent difficulty in maintaining attention and concentration, and is frequently accompanied by hyperactive and impulsive behavior.

-CDC

{{% note %}}
The definition from the CDC is that ADHD is a mental condition characterized by persistent difficulty in maintaining attention and concentration, and is frequently accompanied by hyperactive and impulsive behavior. It’s a condition that affects how different brain areas develop and work together. ADHD starts in childhood, but many people don’t get this diagnosis until they’re teenagers or adults.

People who have ADHD are neurodivergent. That means their brains develop and work differently than people who are neurotypical (which means their brains developed and work as expected).

The symptoms of ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) revolve around an issue called executive dysfunction. Executive functions help you manage focus, concentration, emotional regulation, impulse control and self-motivation.

### 3 Subtypes of ADHD

1. Inattentive
2. Hyperactive/Impulsive
3. Mixed

***Source: Psychiatry.org***

{{% note %}}
There are three subtypes of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive and mixed. Women aren’t as likely to have hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. That means they’re less likely to have the hyperactive/impulsive or mixed subtypes. Women are more likely to receive this diagnosis as adults.

<li style="font-size: 0.6em;"><strong>Symptom types:</strong> easier to notice hyperactivity and impulsiveness</li>
<li style="font-size: 0.6em;"><strong>Bias:</strong> since more common in Cis males, not often looked at for Cis women</li>
<li style="font-size: 0.6em;"><strong>Less available research:</strong> with ≠ sample sizes, AFAB rarely included</li>

With **more common symptoms** more visible in men/boys, they get diagnosed more often. And those behaviors are often considered more socially acceptable for them, and so women suppress or hide theirs to fit in better, and don't get diagnosed. **Bias:** 
**Research:** We know most studies don't take equal sample sizes, if they include those Assigned Feminine at Birth at all.
**Inattention symptoms in females** with ADHD are more likely to occur in structured educational environments, such as college, which may delay the diagnosis.

Women are less likely to outgrow ADHD. About 60% of women have ADHD that continues into adulthood, compared with about 30% of men. People who “outgrow” it usually still have some symptoms, but the symptoms eventually aren’t severe enough to meet the criteria for diagnosis.

Males and females also show different patterns of comorbidity, which is when another condition occurs alongside ADHD. 
**Males are more likely** to have externalizing disorders, such as:
**females are more likely** to have internalizing disorders, such as:
Quantitative assessments still focus on external behaviors that interfere with other people. But most women struggle with an internalized sense of impairment that affects their sense of self and qualitative life management skills. Men generally lack this sense of impairment, and automatically assume they're doing _just fine_

My diagnosis of course wasn’t a surprise, because as I mentioned before, to my parents, ADHD was a myth and just an attempt by “big-pharma” to make lots of money and get people addicted (this same excuse and faulty reasoning would surface _many_ times from them whenever their Facebook doctor/nurse/“scientist”/etc. had something to sell, or a global pandemic was on the loose, etc.).

But that wasn’t enough. As I adjusted to the medication, along with work and life and such, I had to start all over with understanding how I functioned. I found myself being able to shift easily between different tasks as needed (which I always could - probably too easily), and then REMEMBERING to come back to the previous task (a NEW thing for me). However this also heightened my propensity to overwork and not take the breaks necessary. **I started to understand**, and learn to accept, that some of my shortcomings weren't all my fault, and also that the diagnosis is an explanation not an excuse.

**You understand how your own mind works:** Generally, people with ADHD often excel when taking a "birds eye view" and analyzing potential "what-if's" and hypotheticals, but also sometimes to a detriment when they become tangents.
With so much incoming data, it is **hard to focus** on one thing in particular. But, it enables divergent thinking, filled with creativity and problem solving abilities.

{{% note %}}
Therapy has been a really good resource for me, helping me dig into all of this and identify ways that work for me to get things done and interact and communicate better with those around me. My therapist also introduced me into the idea of practicing mindfulness. Here’s the description from the Mayo Clinic:
{{% /note %}}

---

> Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.

-The Mayo Clinic

{{% note %}}
Spending too much time planning, problem-solving, daydreaming, or thinking negative or random thoughts can be draining. It can also make you more likely to experience stress, anxiety and symptoms of depression. Practicing mindfulness exercises can help you direct your attention away from this kind of thinking and engage with the world around you.

It helped identify one of the biggest triggers for me around my ADHD, and maybe this is for you as well. Whenever I would start to feel anxious, or out of control with what was going on around me, or overwhelmed with tasks, etc. I would start to feel a bit off in my body. It’s hard to describe, but just a feeling of “ugh” and my heart rate kind of spiking, etc.

He helped me to start to recognize when that happened and to identify what I was feeling, what was going on around me, etc. and then to turn that into taking a few moments to breathe. Write down what I was doing, or needed to be done. Go walk around. Get a glass of water. Anything to break up that spiraling moment, and then move forward.
